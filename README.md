# Car Price Prediction

## About Dataset
The dataset [car_price.csv](https://github.com/mhaffizhhh/Car_Price_Prediction/blob/main/car_price.csv) is a collection of data on car prices, containing details about the cars being sold. I will create a regression model to predict the price of a car based on its condition. 
Then, I will evaluate the models to determine which algorithm performs best in predicting the prices.
